# Pogger - Web-Based Ping Pong Game

Pogger is a web-based Ping Pong game created using Kaboom.js, a JavaScript library for game development. Players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen, scoring points when the opponent fails to return the ball.

## Features
- **Gameplay**: Players control paddles (`F` and `J` for left player, `D` and `K` for right player) to hit a ball back and forth.
- **Score Tracking**: Scores are displayed for both players, with sounds indicating when a player scores (`jsfxr_youscored`).
- **Power-ups**: Players can activate power hits (`-5 points`) to increase ball speed using specific key combinations (`F` and `D`).
- **Sound Effects**: Various sound effects enhance gameplay, including ball bounce (`jsfxr_ballbounce`) and paddle hit (`jsfxr_ballhit`).
- **Instructions**: A hint text (`[F / J] = Jump\n[D / K] = Power Hit (-5)`) provides instructions on controls and power-ups.
